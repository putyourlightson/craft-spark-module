# Spark Plug Module for Craft CMS

This module provides the core functionality for the [Spark plugin](https://github.com/putyourlightson/craft-spark), a real-time, template-driven hypermedia framework for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/). If you are developing a Craft plugin/module and would like to use Spark in the control panel, you can require this package to give you its functionality, without requiring that the Spark plugin is installed.

First require the package in your plugin/module's `composer.json` file.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "putyourlightson/craft-spark-plug": "^1.0.0-alpha.1"
  }
}
```

Then bootstrap the module from within your plugin/module's `init` method.

```php
use craft\base\Plugin;
use putyourlightson\spark\Spark;

class MyPlugin extends Plugin
{
    public function init()
    {
        parent::init();

        Spark::bootstrap();
    }
}
```

Then use the Spark function and tags as normal in your control panel templates.

```twig
<button data-on-click="{{ spark('_spark/search') }}">Search</button>
```
